# ANDROID_BUILD — POS & KDS Android APKs for pilot testing

> Scope: **ANDROID-001** (build/packaging setup only). This documents how to build
> installable **Android APKs** for the two on-device role apps, **`apps/pos`**
> (cashier) and **`apps/kds`** (kitchen), so they can run on restaurant tablets for
> the hardware pilot. Motivation: the hosted **web** builds ([DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md))
> cannot reliably reach Bluetooth / Wi-Fi / USB thermal printers from a browser; a
> native Android package is the path toward native printer support.
>
> This ticket added the Android platform scaffolding and configured app identity.
> It did **not** wire native printing and did **not** change any backend, schema,
> migration, or hosted deployment.

## 1. App identity

| App | Directory | `applicationId` (package) | Launcher label |
|---|---|---|---|
| RestoFlow POS | `apps/pos` | `com.restoflow.pos` | **RestoFlow POS** |
| RestoFlow KDS | `apps/kds` | `com.restoflow.kds` | **RestoFlow KDS** |

The two IDs are distinct, so both apps install side-by-side on one tablet. Identity
is set in each app's `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (`namespace` + `applicationId`),
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (`android:label`), and
`android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/restoflow/<pos|kds>/MainActivity.kt` (`package`).

---

## 2. Prerequisites (the build machine)

- **Flutter `3.44.2`** (the version pinned for CI/web — see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) §1).
- **Android SDK** (via Android Studio or the command-line tools). Set `ANDROID_HOME`
  / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, or point Flutter at it with `flutter config --android-sdk <path>`.
- **JDK 17** (bundled with a recent Android Studio; `compileOptions`/`jvmTarget` target 17).
- Confirm the toolchain with `flutter doctor` — the **Android toolchain** row must be `[√]`.

> **NOTE**: The initial ANDROID-001 packaging ran in an environment with **no
> Android SDK/JDK** (`flutter doctor` reported `[X] Android toolchain`), so the APK
> binaries were not produced then. After the toolchain was installed, both **debug
> APKs build successfully** — `flutter build apk --debug` for `apps/pos` and
> `apps/kds` (verified). Confirm `flutter doctor` shows the Android row as `[√]`
> before building.

## 3. Build commands

Run from each app directory (`apps/pos`, then `apps/kds`).

### 3a. Demo-mode APK (no backend, no secrets) — easiest for first install

The apps default to **demo mode** (`RESTOFLOW_DEMO_MODE` defaults `true`), which runs
fully offline with seeded data and needs **no** environment values. Good for verifying
install + UI on a tablet.

```bash
cd apps/pos && flutter build apk --debug     # -> debug APK, no signing needed
cd apps/kds && flutter build apk --debug
```

### 3b. Real-backend APK (hosted Supabase) — for a real pilot

Real mode is enabled with `--dart-define`, using the **same env-var NAMES as the web
build** (never literal secret values in source or in this doc). The **anon key is the
PUBLIC key** (RLS-gated) — never a service-role/secret key (**DECISION D-011**). Set
`RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_URL` and `RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your shell env first (the
same values used for Vercel — see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) §2):

```bash
cd apps/pos && flutter build apk --release \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_DEMO_MODE=false \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_URL="$RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_URL" \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="$RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

cd apps/kds && flutter build apk --release \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_DEMO_MODE=false \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_URL="$RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_URL" \
  --dart-define=RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="$RESTOFLOW_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
```

Notes:
- The `main` (release) manifest declares `android.permission.INTERNET` so real-mode
  login / device pairing / sync work on a release build (ANDROID-001 fix).
- `RESTOFLOW_PRINT_BRIDGE_URL` is a per-device **local loopback** define only; it is
  never a hosted value and is not needed for a normal pilot build.
- A `--release` APK is signed with the **debug** key by default (see §5) — fine for
  sideloading in a pilot, not for the Play Store.

### 3c. Output paths

```
apps/pos/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk     (or app-release.apk)
apps/kds/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk     (or app-release.apk)
```

---

## 4. Installing on a tablet

- **With adb (USB debugging on):**
  ```bash
  adb install -r apps/pos/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
  adb install -r apps/kds/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
  ```
- **Manual:** copy the `.apk` to the tablet (USB / cloud / link) and tap it in a file
  manager. Allow "install unknown apps" for that source. Both apps appear as
  **RestoFlow POS** and **RestoFlow KDS**.

---

## 5. Follow-ups (out of scope for ANDROID-001)

- **Release signing (before Play Store or a signed pilot).** Generate a keystore,
  add `android/key.properties` (git-ignored) and a `release` `signingConfig` in each
  `android/app/build.gradle.kts`. **No keystore/keys were invented or committed** by
  this ticket. `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `key.properties`, and `local.properties` are
  git-ignored; keep the keystore out of the repo.
- **Play Store.** App bundle (`flutter build appbundle`), store listing, versioning
  (`versionCode`/`versionName` — currently Flutter defaults), privacy declarations,
  and a signed upload key. Not started.
- **Native printing.** The `restoflow_printing` package already contains an ESC/POS
  adapter and a **local loopback print-bridge client** (honest `sent ≠ printed`), but
  **native (Bluetooth/USB/Wi-Fi) printing is NOT wired** — it needs a platform printer
  plugin/adapter and its own ticket. See **OPEN QUESTION Q-015** (encoding/raster
  fallback for Arabic/Hebrew) in [OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) and the
  printing owner doc [PRINTERS_AND_HARDWARE_SPEC.md](PRINTERS_AND_HARDWARE_SPEC.md).

## 6. Security & safety notes

- **No secrets in the repo.** URL/anon key are injected at compile time via
  `--dart-define` (env-var NAMES), never hardcoded; the anon key is public.
  `SupabaseBootstrapConfig` fails closed on a missing/placeholder/service-role key.
- **KDS is money-free.** The Android packaging adds no money handling; the kitchen
  app stays money-free.
- **Web deploy unchanged.** This ticket did not touch `apps/*/web/`,
  `tools/vercel_build_web.sh`, or `vercel.json`; the Vercel web build is unaffected.
